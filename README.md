# Soso Design Handbook

In the wiki of this repository you'll find Sosolimited's Design Handbook, created to establish a shared language and base of knowledge about design to improve collaboration between designers and developers. The lessons and resources curated here cover foundational design principles with a particular focus on how to apply them to screen-based media.

Access all of the lessons and materials through the [wiki](https://github.com/sosolimited/Design-Handbook/wiki).
